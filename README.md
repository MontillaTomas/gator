# Gator üêä

An RSS feed aggregator CLI tool built in Go. Gator (aggreGATOR) allows you to collect RSS feeds from across the internet, store posts in a PostgreSQL database, and browse aggregated content directly from your terminal.

## Features

- Add and manage RSS feeds from any source
- Store collected posts in PostgreSQL
- Follow and unfollow feeds added by any user
- Browse recent posts with links to full content
- Multi-user support with authentication

## Prerequisites

Before installing Gator, ensure you have:

- **Go** (version 1.16 or higher) - [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **PostgreSQL** - [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

Install Gator using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/yourusername/gator@latest
```

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's PATH to run the `gator` command.

## Configuration

Create a `.gatorconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": ""
}
```

Replace the placeholders with your PostgreSQL connection details:
- `<username>`: Your PostgreSQL username (e.g., `postgres`)
- `<password>`: Your PostgreSQL password
- `<host>`: Database host (e.g., `localhost`)
- `<port>`: PostgreSQL port (default: `5432`)
- `<database_name>`: Name of your database (e.g., `gator`)

Example:
```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": ""
}
```
